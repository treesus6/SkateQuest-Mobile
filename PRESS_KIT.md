## Elevator Pitch

**One Sentence:**
SkateQuest is a gamified skateboarding community app that helps skaters discover spots, track progress, and collectively donate skateboards to underprivileged kids through an innovative QR scavenger hunt system.

**Extended (100 words):**
SkateQuest transforms skateboarding into a connected, gamified experience while creating real social impact. Skaters use our Progressive Web App to discover and share skate spots worldwide, join crews, track sessions, and compete for XP and achievements. Our unique charity program lets users purchase custom QR codes with trick challenges, hide them around cities, and turn every scavenger hunt into a donation that funds skateboards for kids from underserved communities. With 30 million skateboarders worldwide and growing, SkateQuest is positioned to become the operating system for skateboarding culture.

---

## The Story

### The Problem

Thirty million skateboarders worldwide lack a unified platform to discover spots, connect with their community, and track their progression. Meanwhile, 15% of youth skateboarders come from underserved communities where a $100-300 complete skateboard setup is financially out of reach.

### The Solution

SkateQuest is the first comprehensive skateboarding platform that combines:

- **Community Discovery** - Interactive map of skate spots worldwide
- **Social Gaming** - XP, achievements, crews, and leaderboards
- **Event Organization** - Local meetups, competitions, and sessions
- **Social Impact** - Charity QR scavenger hunts that fund skateboards for kids in need

### What Makes Us Different

Unlike existing skateboarding apps that focus on a single feature (just mapping spots, or just social features), SkateQuest is the only platform that integrates the complete skateboarding experience with charitable giving. We're not just building an app - we're building a movement.
